# This script performs the following tasks:


==> Sets up configuration values, including timeouts and memory limits.

==> Defines variables, including the target URL, default credentials, paths to user and log files, and a function for generating random passwords.

==> Creates an HTTP session using cURL and logs into the target website or application with the default password.

==> Loads a list of users from a file and iterates through the list, generating a new random password for each user and sending a password change request using cURL. The script logs success or failure for each operation in a separate log file.

==> Uses OWASP ZAP (an automated vulnerability scanner) to scan the target website or application for security vulnerabilities. The script logs any alerts generated by ZAP in the same log file as the password change operations.

==> Cleans up and closes the HTTP session.
